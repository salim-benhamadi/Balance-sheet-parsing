# Brief Description

Business organizations receive regular volumes of documents regularly. One of them is a financial statement. Extracting each document manually is difficult and time-consuming. Automated data extraction helps in preceding the data extraction in seconds. It does not require a long time frame. Automated data extraction extracts necessary data precisely into excel, XML, CVS, or JSON format and uses Google Sheets integration.

The financial statement deals with sensitive documents which are not easier to extract manually. There are risks of stealing, leaking, and misplacing documents. While using automated data extraction methods, the risks wonâ€™t bother anymore. Following the automated process has made it easy.
